=====================
docker node rm (id)
docker swarm leave --force
docker node js

create it again
===============
docker swarm init -advertise-addr (ipaddressofdockerswarm)
copy the command and paste in the dockler nodes machines 


Tokens (Manager and Node)
===========================
docker swarm join-token worker
docker swarrm join-token manager

Docker service and replicas
===================
docker service create --name myservice --replicas 3 --publish 80:80 httpd
docker service ps myservice
docker ps
docker rm -f servivename
docker ps (it will recreated)
Browse the ip and check
docker service rm myservice
docker service create --name myservice --replicas 6 --publish 80:80 httpd
